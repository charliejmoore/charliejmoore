### 🙋🏻 Hi there

I'm Charlie, a full stack software engineer with 7+ years of professional experience. I am currently working in mobile development in the IoT space. I have prior experience in developing web applications to enable users to perform complex tasks, where they need to generate insights and understand relationships in large amounts of dynamic and uncertain data.
